### Changed

-   Made the `email` parameter option in `unverifyEmail`, `revokeEmailVerificationTokens`, `isEmailVerified`, `verifyEmailUsingToken`, `createEmailVerificationToken` of the `EmailVerification` recipe.

### Added

-   Support for FDI 1.15

### Breaking changes

-   Removes support for FDI < 1.15
-   Changed `signInUp` third party recipe function to accept an email string instead of an object that takes `{id: string, isVerified: boolean}`.
-   Renames `STMP` to `SMTP` everywhere (typo).
-   The frontend SDK should be updated to a version supporting session claims!
    -   supertokens-auth-react: >= 0.25.0
    -   supertokens-web-js: >= 0.2.0
-   `EmailVerification` recipe is now not initialized as part of auth recipes, it should be added to the `recipeList` directly instead.
-   Email verification related overrides (`emailVerificationFeature` prop of `override`) moved from auth recipes into the `EmailVerification` recipe config.
-   Email verificitaion related configs (`emailVerificationFeature` props) moved from auth recipes into the `EmailVerification` config object root.
-   ThirdParty recipe no longer takes emailDelivery config -> use emailverification recipe's emailDelivery instead.
-   Moved email verification related configs from the `emailDelivery` config of auth recipes into a separate `EmailVerification` email delivery config.
-   Updated return type of `getEmailForUserId` in the `EmailVerification` recipe config. It should now return an object with status.
-   Removed `getResetPasswordURL`, `getEmailVerificationURL`, `getLinkDomainAndPath`. Changing these urls can be done in the email delivery configs instead.
-   Removed `unverifyEmail`, `revokeEmailVerificationTokens`, `isEmailVerified`, `verifyEmailUsingToken` and `createEmailVerificationToken` from auth recipes. These should be called on the `EmailVerification` recipe instead.
-   Changed function signature for email verification APIs to accept a session as an input.
-   Changed Session API interface functions:
    -   `refreshPOST` now returns a Session container object.
    -   `signOutPOST` now takes in an optional session object as a parameter.

### Migration

Before:

```
SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "...",
    },
    recipeList: [
        EmailPassword.init({
            emailVerificationFeature: {
                // these options should be moved into the config of the EmailVerification recipe
            },
            override: {
                emailVerificationFeature: {
                    // these overrides should be moved into the overrides of the EmailVerification recipe
                }
            }
        })
    ]
})
```

After the update:

```
SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "...",
    },
    recipeList: [
        EmailVerification.init({
            // all config should be moved here from the emailVerificationFeature prop of the EmailPassword recipe config
            override: {
                // move the overrides from the emailVerificationFeature prop of the override config in the EmailPassword init here
            }
        }),
        EmailPassword.init()
    ]
})
```

#### Passwordless users and email verification

If you turn on email verification your email-based passwordless users may be redirected to an email verification screen in their existing session.
Logging out and logging in again will solve this problem or they could click the link in the email to verify themselves.

You can avoid this by running a script that will:

1. list all users of passwordless
2. create an emailverification token for each of them if they have email addresses
3. user the token to verify their address

Something similar to this script:

```ts
const SuperTokens = require("supertokens-node");
const Session = require("supertokens-node/recipe/session");
const Passwordless = require("supertokens-node/recipe/passwordless");
const EmailVerification = require("supertokens-node/recipe/emailverification");

SuperTokens.init({
    supertokens: {
        // TODO: This is a core hosted for demo purposes. You can use this, but make sure to change it to your core instance URI eventually.
        connectionURI: "https://try.supertokens.com",
        apiKey: "<REQUIRED FOR MANAGED SERVICE, ELSE YOU CAN REMOVE THIS FIELD>",
    },
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "...",
    },
    recipeList: [
        EmailVerification.init({
            mode: "REQUIRED",
        }),
        Passwordless.init({
            contactMethod: "EMAIL_OR_PHONE",
            flowType: "USER_INPUT_CODE_AND_MAGIC_LINK",
        }),
        Session.init(),
    ],
});

async function main() {
    let paginationToken = undefined;
    let done = false;
    while (!done) {
        const userList = await SuperTokens.getUsersNewestFirst({
            includeRecipeIds: ["passwordless"],
            limit: 100,
            paginationToken,
        });

        for (const { recipeId, user } of userList.users) {
            if (recipeId === "passwordless" && user.email) {
                const tokenResp = await EmailVerification.createEmailVerificationToken(user.id, user.email);
                if (tokenResp.status === "OK") {
                    await EmailVerification.verifyEmailUsingToken(tokenResp.token);
                }
            }
        }

        done = userList.nextPaginationToken !== undefined;
        if (!done) {
            paginationToken = userList.nextPaginationToken;
        }
    }
}

main().then(console.log, console.error);
```

#### User roles

The UserRoles recipe now adds role and permission information into the access token payload by default. If you are already doing this manually, this will result in duplicate data in the access token.

-   You can disable this behaviour by setting `skipAddingRolesToAccessToken` and `skipAddingPermissionsToAccessToken` to true in the recipe init.
-   Check how to use the new claims in our user roles docs on our website.

#### Next.js integration

-   Since a new exception type has been added, there is a required change in SRR (`getServerSideProps`). You should handle the new (`INVALID_CLAIMS`) exception in the same way as you handle `UNAUTHORISED`
-   Please check our updated guide on our website

#### AWS integration

-   The new exception type and error code requires changes if you are using SuperTokens as as an Authorizer in API Gateways.
-   You need to handle the new exception type in the authorizer code.
-   You need to configure the "Access Denied" response.
-   Please check our updated guide on our website

## [11.3.0] - 2022-08-30

### Added:

-   `authUsername` option in smtp config for when email is different than the username for auth.

## [11.2.0] - 2022-08-26

### Adds:

-   Adds a Dashboard recipe

## [11.1.2] - 2022-08-25

### Type fix:

-   Makes `userContext` optional in `sendEmail` and `sendSms` function in all recipe exposed functions.

## [11.1.1] - 2022-08-11

### Bug fix:

-   Adds missing `force` param from `createUserIdMapping` and `deleteUserIdMapping` functions

## [11.1.0] - 2022-08-11

### Adds:

-   UserId Mapping functionality and compatibility with CDI 2.15
-   Adds `createUserIdMapping`, `getUserIdMapping`, `deleteUserIdMapping`, `updateOrDeleteUserIdMappingInfo` functions

## [11.0.3] - 2022-08-05

### Bug fix:

-   Fixes overrides not applying correctly in methods called on SessionContainer instances

## [11.0.2] - 2022-08-02

### Bug fix:

-   Solves the issue of request getting stuck in non returning state while parsing form data for nextjs request

## [11.0.1] - 2022-07-18

### Fixes

-   Fixed fastify issue where same cookie was getting set multiple times on the response object

### Adds:

-   Improved type definitions for `SessionWrapper.getSession`.

## [11.0.0] - 2022-07-05

### Breaking change:

-   Changes session function recipe interfaces to not throw an UNAUTHORISED error when the input is a sessionHandle: https://github.com/supertokens/backend/issues/83
    -   `getSessionInformation` now returns `undefined` is the session does not exist
    -   `updateSessionData` now returns `false` if the input `sessionHandle` does not exist.
    -   `updateAccessTokenPayload` now returns `false` if the input `sessionHandle` does not exist.
    -   `regenerateAccessToken` now returns `undefined` if the input access token's `sessionHandle` does not exist.
    -   The sessionClass functions have not changed in behaviour and still throw UNAUTHORISED. This works cause the sessionClass works on the current session and not some other session.

### Bug fix:

-   Clears cookies when revokeSession is called using the session container, even if the session did not exist from before: https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-node/issues/343

## [10.0.1] - 2022-06-28

### Fixes

-   Fixed handling of unicode characters in usermetadata (and emails, roles, session/access token payload data)

### Adds:

-   Adds default userContext for API calls that contains the request object. It can be used in APIs / functions override like so:

```ts
signIn: async function (input) {
    if (input.userContext._default && input.userContext._default.request) {
        // do something here with the request object
    }
}
```

## [10.0.0] - 2022-06-2

### Breaking change

-   https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-node/issues/220
    -   Adds `{status: "GENERAL_ERROR", message: string}` as a possible output to all the APIs.
    -   Changes `FIELD_ERROR` output status in third party recipe API to be `GENERAL_ERROR`.
    -   Replaced `FIELD_ERROR` status type in third party signinup API with `GENERAL_ERROR`.
    -   Removed `FIELD_ERROR` status type from third party signinup recipe function.
-   If sms or email sending failed in passwordless recipe APIs, we now throw a regular JS error from the API as opposed to returning a `GENERAL_ERROR` to the client.
-   If there is an error whilst getting the profile info about a user from a third party provider (in /signinup POST API), then we throw a regular JS error instead of returning a `GENERAL_ERROR` to the client.
-   Changes SuperTokensSMS service to take an API key directly as opposed to take an object that takes an API key
-   Passes only base request and base response objects to session recipe implementation functions. Normalisation of raw res and raw response is now done in the session's index.ts file
-   Removes support for faunadb session recipe modifier.
-   Removes support for FDI < 1.14

### Changes

-   Fixes Cookie sameSite config validation.
-   Fixes a few typos
-   Changes `getEmailForUserIdForEmailVerification` function inside thirdpartypasswordless to take into account passwordless emails and return an empty string in case a passwordless email doesn't exist. This helps situations where the dev wants to customise the email verification functions in the thirdpartypasswordless recipe.

### Fixes

-   Fixes email undefined error when resending the passwordless login email.

## [9.3.0] - 2022-06-17

### Added

-   Adds User Roles recipe and compatibility with CDI 2.14
-   `emailDelivery` user config for Emailpassword, Thirdparty, ThirdpartyEmailpassword, Passwordless and ThirdpartyPasswordless recipes.
-   `smsDelivery` user config for Passwordless and ThirdpartyPasswordless recipes.
-   `Twilio` service integartion for smsDelivery ingredient.
-   `SMTP` service integration for emailDelivery ingredient.
-   `Supertokens` service integration for smsDelivery ingredient.

### Deprecated

-   For Emailpassword recipe input config, `resetPasswordUsingTokenFeature.createAndSendCustomEmail` and `emailVerificationFeature.createAndSendCustomEmail` have been deprecated.
-   For Thirdparty recipe input config, `emailVerificationFeature.createAndSendCustomEmail` has been deprecated.
-   For ThirdpartyEmailpassword recipe input config, `resetPasswordUsingTokenFeature.createAndSendCustomEmail` and `emailVerificationFeature.createAndSendCustomEmail` have been deprecated.
-   For Passwordless recipe input config, `createAndSendCustomEmail` and `createAndSendCustomTextMessage` have been deprecated.
-   For ThirdpartyPasswordless recipe input config, `createAndSendCustomEmail`, `createAndSendCustomTextMessage` and `emailVerificationFeature.createAndSendCustomEmail` have been deprecated.

### Migration

Following is an example of ThirdpartyPasswordless recipe migration. If your existing code looks like

```ts
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import ThirdpartyPasswordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartypasswordless";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "...",
    },
    recipeList: [
        ThirdpartyPasswordless.init({
            contactMethod: "EMAIL_OR_PHONE",
            createAndSendCustomEmail: async (input, userContext) => {
                // some custom logic
            },
            createAndSendCustomTextMessage: async (input, userContext) => {
                // some custom logic
            },
            flowType: "...",
            emailVerificationFeature: {
                createAndSendCustomEmail: async (user, emailVerificationURLWithToken, userContext) => {
                    // some custom logic
                },
            },
        }),
    ],
});
```

After migration to using new `emailDelivery` and `smsDelivery` config, your code would look like:

```ts
import SuperTokens from "supertokens-auth-react";
import ThirdpartyPasswordless from "supertokens-auth-react/recipe/thirdpartypasswordless";

SuperTokens.init({
    appInfo: {
        apiDomain: "...",
        appName: "...",
        websiteDomain: "..."
    },
    recipeList: [
        ThirdpartyPasswordless.init({
            contactMethod: "EMAIL_OR_PHONE",
            emailDelivery: {
                service: {
                    sendEmail: async (input) => {
                        let userContext = input.userContext;
                        if(input.type === "EMAIL_VERIFICATION") {
                            // some custom logic
                        } else if (input.type === "PASSWORDLESS_LOGIN") {
                            // some custom logic
                        }
                    }
                }
            },
            smsDelivery: {
                service: {
                    sendSms: async (input) => {
                        // some custom logic for sending passwordless login SMS
                    }
                }
            }
            flowType: "..."
        })
    ]
})
```

## [7.0.0] - 2021-07-31

### Added

-   Multiple framework support. Currently supporting express, koa, hapi, fastify, awsLambda and loopback
-   BaseRequest and BaseResponse interface added which will be used inside recipe instead of previously used express.Request and express.Response
-   `framework` config option. Default value is `express`.
-   basic tests for all frameworks.

### Changed

-   Following functions are changed in default SuperTokens class (supertokens.ts):
    -   middleware: instead of taking no option and returning an express middleware, it now takes 2 parameters: BaseRequest and BaseResponse and returns a boolean. If response was send by the middleware, it returns true, else false
    -   handleAPI: no longer take `next` parameter. Also the request and response parameter will be of type BaseRequest and BaseResponse.
    -   errorHandler: instead of taking no option and returning an express error middleware, it now takes 3 parameters: error object, BaseRequest and BaseResponse
-   Cookie and Header handling will part be delegated to specific framework.
-   Request and Response parameters passwed in functions `createNewSession`, `getSession` and `refreshSession` can by of any type and not `express.Request` and `express.Response`.
-   middleware, errorHandler should be imported from specific framework (i.e. `import {middleware, errorHandler} from "supertokens-node/framework/express"`). Also, errorHandler may not be there for few frameworksas it may not be required.
-   verifySession should be imported from specific framework, from session recipe (i.e. `import {verifySession} from "supertokens-node/recipe/session/framework/express"`).
-   `handleAPIRequest` in recipe modules will no longer take `next` parameter. Also the request and response parameter will be of type BaseRequest and BaseResponse.
-   `handleAPIRequest` in recipe modules will return boolean. If the response is sent from `handleAPIRequest`, the function will return true else it will return false.
-   `handleError` in recipe modules will no longer take `next` parameter. Also the request and response parameter will be of type BaseRequest and BaseResponse. If error is not handled by the function, it will rethrow the error.
-   All the API implementation functions should return a boolean. If response is sent, `true` will be returned else false.
-   `verifySession` which was defined in `middleware.ts` file is now removed.
-   Changed `UNKNOWN_USER_ID` to `UNKNOWN_USER_ID_ERROR` to make it more consistent with other status types: https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-node/issues/166

### Deprecated

-   middleware, errorHandler imported directly from supertokens-node (i.e. `import {middleware, errorHandler} from "supertokens-node"`)
-   verifySession imported directly from session recipe (i.e. `import {verifySession} from "supertokens-node/recipe/session"`)

### Breaking changes

-   In `ThirdParty` recipe, for type `TypeProviderGetResponse`, the field `authorisationRedirect.params` will be of type `{ [key: string]: string | ((request: BaseRequest) => string) }`. Earlier, the request was of type express.Request.
-   For all the recipes' `APIOptions`, their will be no `next` parameter. Also the request and response parameter will be of type BaseRequest and BaseResponse.
-   Updated minimum Oauth scopes required for various thirdparty providers.
-   For thirdparty providers, if the scope array is passed by the user, the default scopes will not be used.
-   Changes to emailpassword, emailverification, thirdpartyemailpassword and thirdparty functions to not return errors implicitly: https://github.com/supertokens/supertokens-node/issues/167
-   The req and res objects in the error handlers config for session recipe are not of type express anymore, but are of type BaseResponse and BaseRequest
